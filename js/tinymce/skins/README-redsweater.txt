Basically I want to tweak lightgray a bit but don't seem to be able to impose my tweaks reliably dynamically at runtime. So I maintain a separate theme for redsweater that is based on lightgray, and currently built manually from a full copy of lightgray, then applying the patches in redsweater-patches.
