"redsweater" skin

In our fork of TinyMCE we maintain a collection of manually applicable patches that can be used to create a modified version of the lightgray theme that meets our expectations. The patches should be applied by literally copying lightgray, then applying each patch in "redsweater-lightgray-skin-patches"

other changes

Other changes have been made throughout the JavaScript tree and should be perpetuated whenever we merge with upstream.
